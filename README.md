# weathertext
This is a command-line-interface weather program I wrote to help me start my mornings! Simply run the command "weathertext" and enter your zipcode to learn about upcoming weather for the day. It's extremely fast and helps you dodge all those annoying weather site advertisements and load times

Note: My API Key is expired and if you'd like to run this program for yourself, you'll need to generate a new one and recompile!
